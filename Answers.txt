1) In python, the size of float and integer is the same in terms of bytes then how is it able to store such large values?

Integers are stored as exact values whereas floars are stored as approx values. Floating point numbers use a scientific notation type format such as 5^20, 5^-20 etc
and hence can store larger values as approximations.

2) How many bits are there in 1GB and 1MB?

1 byte = 8 bits
1 MB = 8 * (10^6) bits = 8000000 bits , 8 million bits
1 GB =  8*(10^9) bits = 8000000000 bits , 8 billion bits
